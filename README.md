I am aiming to make 2 projects but as I am learning and testing, it has consequently resulted in making other cool side projects that others may find useful. I'll post just the code and video demo's of the side projects, and preserve this readme for the project 1 and 2.

1. **SWOLE TIMER** is a workout rest timer for my home gym: Pressing an arcade button will start a countdown of 60 seconds, 60 seconds × 2, 60 seconds × 3, etc. At the end of the timer, a buzzer will go off, and an LED light will display, reminding me to get off my phone. Pressing the arcade button will add 30 seconds to the timer; pressing it twice will add another 30 seconds, making it 60 seconds, and so on. Finally, holding the button will shut down the timer.
Why? Because I rest too long, and there isn’t enough time in this world to waste on wasting time + wasting gains.

2. **PROJECT HELLO NEIGHBOR** is a negative reinforcement vibration retaliation device. A shock sensor detects vibrations caused by excessive stomping from upstairs neighbors. Once a vibration is detected, multiple vibration motors (similar to those found in phones) attached to the ceiling are triggered to respond immediately in retaliation.
Why? Because I cannot keep getting up to bang on my ceiling, it will break, I will break. I am no scientist but phone vibrations are so crisp and loud when they travel across levels or rooms..This sparked the idea..
