I am aiming to make 2 projects but as I am learning and testing, it has consequently resulted in making other cool side projects that others may find useful. I'll post just the code and video demo's of the side projects, and preserve this readme for the project 1 and 2.

1. A workout rest timer for my home gym: Pressing an arcade button will start a countdown of 60s, 60s x 2, 60s x 3, etc. At the end of the timer, a buzzer will go off, light LED light will display, telling myself to get off my phone. Pressing the arcade button will add 30 seconds to increment the timer, pressing it twice will add another 30seconds timer making it 60seconds, etc., Finally, Holding the button will shutdown the timer.
Why? Because I rest too long, and there isn't enough time in this world to be wasted on wasting time + wasting gains.

3. Negative reinforcement Vibration Retaliation Device - A vibration detection sensor will trigger when it hears your upstairs neighbors stomping at an inhumanely level. Once a vibration is detected, this will trigger multiple vibration motors(like the ones in your phones) attached to your ceiling in retaliation to immediately respond back to their attack.
Why? Because I cannot keep getting up to bang on my ceiling, it will break, I will break. I am no scientist but phone vibrations are so crisp and loud when they travel across levels or rooms..This sparked the idea..
