1. **SWOLE TIMER** is a workout rest timer for my home gym: Pressing an arcade button will start a countdown of 60 seconds, 60 seconds × 2, 60 seconds × 3, etc. At the end of the timer, a buzzer will go off, and an LED light will display, reminding me to get off my phone. Pressing the arcade button will add 30 seconds to the timer; pressing it twice will add another 30 seconds, making it 60 seconds, and so on. Finally, holding the button will shut down the timer.
Why? Because I rest too long, and there isn’t enough time in this world to waste on wasting time + wasting gains.

will update readme later
