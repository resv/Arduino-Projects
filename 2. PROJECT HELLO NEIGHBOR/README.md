**PROJECT HELLO NEIGHBOR** is a negative reinforcement vibration retaliation device. A shock sensor detects vibrations caused by excessive stomping from upstairs neighbors. Once a vibration is detected, multiple vibration motors (similar to those found in phones) attached to the ceiling are triggered to respond immediately in retaliation.
Why? Because I cannot keep getting up to bang on my ceiling, it will break, I will break. I am no scientist but phone vibrations are so crisp and loud when they travel across levels or rooms..This sparked the idea..
